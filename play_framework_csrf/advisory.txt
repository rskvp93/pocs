================= CSRF Protection Bypass =================================
1. Introduction
Play framework documentation: https://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.2.x/ScalaCsrf
Play supports multiple methods for verifying that a request is not a CSRF request. 
The primary mechanism is a CSRF token. This token gets placed either in the query string or body of every form submitted, 
and also gets placed in the users session. Play then verifies that both tokens are present and match.
To allow simple protection for non browser requests, such as requests made through AJAX, Play also supports the following:
- If an X-Requested-With header is present, Play will consider the request safe. 
  X-Requested-With is added to requests by many popular Javascript libraries, such as jQuery.
- If a Csrf-Token header with value nocheck is present, or with a valid CSRF token, Play will consider the request safe.
2. Vulnerability
Weak protection (X-Requested-With and custom Csrf-Token) can be bypass with Flash + 307 redirect
Technical: 
It's possible to send the "X-Requested-With" header with Flash, 
but we can't send it cross-domain due to the SOP implementation with Adobe's crossdomain.xml files. 
However, we can trick Flash into sending the request anyway by issuing the request to a domain that does allow it, 
which in turn sends a HTTP 307 redirect to the resource that we want to target. 
Flash will send the request to the new resource before requesting crossdomain.xml on the new domain.

3. POC
I created a POC test X-Requested-With on newest Chrome
- victim.com:9000 (Play project with enable CSRF Protection)
- attacker.com:8080 (Python Flask project: Flash + 307 redirect)
Chrome requests http://attacker.com:8080/
Chrome requests http://attacker.com:8080/TestCSRF.swf
SWF requests http://attacker.com:8080/crossdomain.xml
SWF requests http://attacker.com:8080/redirect307 (issues 307 redirect to post http://victim.com:9000/submit)
SWF requests http://victim.com:9000/submit(including the X-Requested-With header and post data)
SWF requests https://developer.vimeo.com/crossdomain.xml (404 not found but victim acttually pwned)
